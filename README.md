# Help-App (name under construction :D)
An app that helps teachers manage students help requests like answering students questions about a homework or a topic they dont understand and at the 
same time keeping track of who needs help.

Libraries & Frameworks used:
Spring boot for fast auto configuration, Spring MVC for http GET / POST, Spring Security for authentication and authorization of
users in the application, Hibernate for data management, JSP for building dynamic web contents and
Bootstrap to create responsive front-end development.

Build tool:
Maven

Data storage:
PostgreSQL

Application server:
Since the application uses spring mvc, springboot will automatically start an
instance of apache tomcat.
